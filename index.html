Our methodology for this project is to take a dart board and place sticky noted ideas on it. From here the team will be blindfolded and throw darts at the board until a research project good enough to be funded by the University is formulated. Once funding is acquired a large party will be thrown that will utilize 53% of our budget. From there we will realize that we do not have enough money to continue the project and cancel the research. While this is happening we will be sure to document the process in full using quantitative methods such as how many tears were shed searching for frameworks as well as how long the researchers sanity will last until they finally break down.

                <br>
								The notion of pathetic research projects has been around ever since the dawn of professors searching for some way convince the university to give them money. This project plans to utilize this motive to it's full potential by delving deep into academic tomfoolery. This will be accomplished by comparing a list of top travel destinations and potential conferences and ensuring that the team will be able to attend all of them. From this analysis we will be able to optimize our travel budget and ensure that we travel to all of the top destinations in the world. The only downside to this is that we may have to occasionally share our trips with other conference speakers who may or may not be undergraduate students. We might also find that using lorem ipsum and stream of conciousness to write our papers is not a sustainable solution to our problem.
